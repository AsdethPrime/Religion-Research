Suray 1-34 [ Talks about god] - Story of Imran starts from Aayat 35.
=> There is no other diety than Allah
=> He send down Quran, Torah and Gospel
=> Nothing is hidden from him, even your deepest thoughts
=> He can do whatever he wants, all he has to say is "Be"
=> The full meaning of Quaran is not known by anyone else but Allah [ 28 verses as the word Alif Lam Meen at the begining which has never been correctly translated)
=> Follow Allah and he will give you (1) Mercy, (2) Guidance
=> Even when beings as powerful as Pharohs ignored gods signs and severe punishment befall them
=> Talks about the battle in Mecca ( Aayah 3.13)
=> Worldly things give you happinesss but nothing compared to what you will get if you are good and reach the garden
=> God teaching is same as in the past, and the interpretation of Torah and Gospel differ with Quaran only where words are intentially manipulated
=> Disbelivers will have severe punishment and no power can help them 
=> And for people who follow their fake religion and belive they won't ever burn will known the turth in Day of Judgement 
=> Remember you came from Allah and to him you will return, but return as believe and you will know peace beyond anything in this world realm, but return to him as a sinner and you will know pain beyond your wildest dreams
=> If you are true to gods teaching, you are forgiven even if you are lead astray ( by the worldly forces) 
=> God specifically choose Adam, Noah the Family of Imran ( Jesus) but his teachning applies to all of humanity.
