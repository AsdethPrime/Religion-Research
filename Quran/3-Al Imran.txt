Suray 1-34 [ Talks about god] - Story of Imran starts from Aayat 35.
=> There is no other diety than Allah
=> He send down Quran, Torah and Gospel
=> Nothing is hidden from him, even your deepest thoughts
=> He can do whatever he wants, all he has to say is "Be"
=> The full meaning of Quaran is not known by anyone else but Allah [ 28 verses as the word Alif Lam Meen at the begining which has never been correctly translated)
=> Follow Allah and he will give you (1) Mercy, (2) Guidance
=> Even when beings as powerful as Pharohs ignored gods signs and severe punishment befall them
=> Talks about the battle in Mecca ( Aayah 3.13)
=> Worldly things give you happinesss but nothing compared to what you will get if you are good and reach the garden
=> God teaching is same as in the past, and the interpretation of Torah and Gospel differ with Quaran only where words are intentially manipulated
=> Disbelivers will have severe punishment and no power can help them 
=> And for people who follow their fake religion and belive they won't ever burn will known the turth in Day of Judgement 
=> Remember you came from Allah and to him you will return, but return as believe and you will know peace beyond anything in this world realm, but return to him as a sinner and you will know pain beyond your wildest dreams
=> If you are true to gods teaching, you are forgiven even if you are lead astray ( by the worldly forces) 
=> God specifically choose Adam, Noah the Family of Imran ( Jesus) but his teachning applies to all of humanity. 

Surah 35 [ Story of Imran begins ] 
=> Imran's wife has not been able to bear children so she decide to offer her 'womb to god'
=> She ends up having a daughter - they name her Mary 
=> Mary is left in charge with Zechariah
=> Every time Zechariah enters Mary's prayer chamber he finds Mary has learn something new and profound ; but whenever he asks why she says its from Allah
=> This amazing Zechariah, who then asks god for a good offspring
=> Angels come visit Zechariah and tell him a prophet is going to be born from you 
=> Zechariah can't believe this , because his wife is barren, but for doubting gods words his voice is taken away for 3 days. 
=> John is born to Zechariah 
=> Mary is visited by angels who is promised a messiah Jesus ( Isha ) would be born of her [3.46 aayat ]
=> Mary asks how its possible when she is a virgin and she is told, if god says 'be' it will just happen
=> Mary is also told Jesus will learn The Torah and The Gospel from god 
=> Jesus will be able to cure the blind and the leper and give life to the dead - by the permission to Allah [ 3.49 aayat ]
Now starts the story of Jesus 
=> Jesus asks : who are my supporter for Allah? and Muslims submit to him
=> All submitted to Jesus including the disbelievers 
=> disbelievers plan but Allah planed as well and Allah is the best planner [3:54]
=> God shows up before Jesus with a message 
"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ."
=> God also says those who follow "give them in full their rewards" 
=> Those who refuse god will punish them "with a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers."


Aayat 3.57 onwards
=> We draw parallel between the story of Adam and story of Jesus 
=> Just like Adam who was created from dust and eventually returned to him
=> Jesus did the same 

Aayat 3.68 
=> Abraham was neither Christian nor Jew, but was Muslim believier in 1 god ( Allah )

Aayat 3.75
=> There are 2 kinds of people 
1) he who, if you entrust him with a great amount, he will return it to you
2)  he who, if you entrust him with a silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him

=> 1 are people of Allah and 2 are disbelievers 
=> True believes should "Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied." [Aayat 3.79]
