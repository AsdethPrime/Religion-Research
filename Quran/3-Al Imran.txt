Suray 1-34 [ Talks about god] - Story of Imran starts from Aayat 35.
=> There is no other diety than Allah
=> He send down Quran, Torah and Gospel
=> Nothing is hidden from him, even your deepest thoughts
=> He can do whatever he wants, all he has to say is "Be"
=> The full meaning of Quaran is not known by anyone else but Allah [ 28 verses as the word Alif Lam Meen at the begining which has never been correctly translated)
=> Follow Allah and he will give you (1) Mercy, (2) Guidance
=> Even when beings as powerful as Pharohs ignored gods signs and severe punishment befall them
=> Talks about the battle in Mecca ( Aayah 3.13)
=> Worldly things give you happinesss but nothing compared to what you will get if you are good and reach the garden
=> God teaching is same as in the past, and the interpretation of Torah and Gospel differ with Quaran only where words are intentially manipulated
=> Disbelivers will have severe punishment and no power can help them 
=> And for people who follow their fake religion and belive they won't ever burn will known the turth in Day of Judgement

=> God specifically choose Adam, Noah the Family of Imran ( Jesus) but his teachning applies to all of humanity. 

Surah 35 [ Story of Imran begins ] 
=> Imran's wife has not been able to bear children so she decide to offer her 'womb to god'
=> She is told she is going to have a child
=> She ends up being pregnant but her husband ( Imran ) dies
=> She gives birth to a baby girl and she freaks out
=> During that time females were not accepted into temple
=> Imran's wife wrapped the baby in a shawl hands it over to the temple elders but deep down was worried people are going to treat Mary bad
=> Mary is handed under Zechariah(Imran's sister's husband) 
=> Zechariah keep Mary on a prayer room locked away from everyone
=> Zechariah visits her daily to check what she wants, but Mary never asks for anything
=> She also always has a basket of fresh fruit in her room
=> He asks Mary who gave you this, Mary says God gave me
=> Zechariah now becomes super interested in Mary and now starts teaching her 
=> Angels come visit Zechariah and tell him a prophet is going to be born from you 
=> Zechariah can't believe this , because his wife is barren, but for doubting gods words his voice is taken away for 3 days. 
=> John is born to Zechariah 

=> Mary is visited by angels who is promised a messiah Jesus ( Issa ) would be born of her [3.46 aayat ]

=> Mary is also told Jesus will learn The Torah and The Gospel from god 
=> Jesus will be able to cure the blind and the leper and give life to the dead - by the permission to Allah [ 3.49 aayat ]
=> Mary is deeply worried because for a virgin to have kid is bad
=> Months passes and Mary can now start feeling kicking inside her 
=> Scared of what people will say she runs away from the template and go to Nazareth 
=> There she starts new life as farm girl ( where did she get money to buy a farm?? ) 
=> She starts questioning her innocent, her purity because she feels god is punishing her
=> Eventually Jesus is born
=> Mary is super unhappy and even says
"I wish I had died before this happened and had vanished into nothingness!"
=> But she hears a voice ( but no one to be seen) 
=> The voice says don't cry there is a small river below you and a tree before you
=> She can see a tree before her but its a dead dried up palm tree
=> The voice continues the river will give you water and the tree will give you sustainance
=> Mary surprised checks the tree, the moment she shakes the tree big ripe dates fall
=> The tree that was dead and dried up, is now big green filled with leaves and has lots of ripe dates
=> With Allah miracle infront of her she finally again start believing her innocence and purity
=> Now with Jesus Mary decide to return to the temple
=> She is worried what people would say , suddenly her baby talks
If you meet any person say: 'I have vowed to fast for The Beneficent and may not speak to any human today.'
=> She is surprised by the miracle and takes Jesus to the template
=> People however start asking questions 
=> People than start saying bad things to her, like this is a grave sin you have committed
=> Mary puts a finger on her lips and points to the child 
=> People start saying how can I ask questions a newborn baby , he cant even speak 
=> But the child start talking: I am god servent and he has blessed me with knoweledge

=> She replies "Yes, the one which Allah created for the first time."
=> He asks  "Is it possible to bear a child without a male partner?" 
=> She replies "Yes, Allah created Adam without male or female!"
=> But a special set of nonbelivers were scared 
=> They were scared everyone will now follow Jesus and their religion will disappear
=> Consequently they would lose their authority over people and decide to hide a lot of facts including Jesus speech 
[ This is interesting because the part of Jesus talking is not in Bible ]

Now starts the story of Jesus 
=> Jesus starts growing and with his age signs of prophethood begins to show
=> He is now able to correctly predict ( or rather tell ) what supper is waiting for their friends at home
=> When he is 12 he is taken to Jerusalem for the first time
=> He should know nothing about the temple, but he runs away and goes to a room where Jews priest is giving lecture 
=> Everyone else are adult, he is 12 year kid alone but he is not scared
=> After the initial lecture the Jews priest asks for comments
=> Jesus, a 12 year kid , and the lecturer start having long arguments ( not heated ) 
=> they both enjoy it so much they both lose track of time
=> Meanwhile Mary is looking for Jesus and cant find him anywhere 
=> Mary eventually finds Jesus in the temple discussing with adults
=> Mary gets angry for Jesus for causing her trouble but all the adults start prasing Jesus knoweledge

=> Jesus grow to manhood
=> It is the day of Sabbath
=> Jesus is walking sees a child who looks hungry

=> Overtime Jesus fulfilled his profecy 
=> He overthrew the existing law and made them follow the teaching of Moses
=> Jesus taught his people to forget about worldly gold and strive for nobel life
=> He was deared loved 
=> But Jesus was in conflict with what he belives is a modification of teaching of Moses and have issues with Jews
=> Jesus kept saying he was not here to abolish the Torah but to extend it
=> Jews did not take kindly to this
=> He starts teaching Jews the meaning of 10 commandments 
=> The 5th commandment is "you shall not kill" 
=> Jesus teaches this kill extends beyond physical to psychological, or spiritual
=> example given you shall not kill someone's dream
=> God then asks Jesus to return to him and says,

// TRYING TO SUMMARISE MAJOR THEMES WITH EVIDENCES

############################ JESUS NOT DEVINE JUST PROPHET #######################################
[ Ayat 33 - 65]

=> Christians and Jews are invites them to accept Islam. 
=> Mary being prophet challanges Jews belief of inferiory of woman 
=> It also refutes the Divinity of Jesus which had been formulated because of his miraculous birth. 
=> For this purpose the instances of John the Baptist to a barren woman 
=> Adam without father and mother 
=> All to show there is nothing in the birth of Jesus without a father to entitle him to Divinity. 

Aayat 3.57 onwards
=> We draw parallel between the story of Adam and story of Jesus 
=> Just like Adam who was created from dust and eventually returned to him
=> Jesus did the same 


################################ Jews and Christians are both invited to read Quaran ##########################
[66 - 101]
=> In these verses the people of the Book, the Jews, have been invited to give up their sinister ways and accept the divine Guidance. 
=> At the same time the Muslims have been warned to be on their guard against their malicious intentions, erroneous ways and absurd objections. 

[102 - 120]
=> The Muslims have been instructed to learn lessons from the history of the people of the Book and 
=> guard themselves against their machinations, and to prepare and train themselves to establish virtue and eradicate evil. 

Aayat 3.68 
=> Abraham was neither Christian nor Jew, but was Muslim believier in 1 god ( Allah )

Aayat 3.75
=> There are 2 kinds of people 
1) he who, if you entrust him with a great amount, he will return it to you
2)  he who, if you entrust him with a silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him

=> 1 are people of Allah and 2 are disbelievers 
=> True believes should "Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied." [Aayat 3.79]

Aayat 3.84 
=> Jews and Christians, at least the true ones are all muslims
"We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims to Him."

#################################### Battle of Uhd ##################################

In this portion, a review of the Battle of Uhd has been mad to teach and reassure the Muslims that the machinations of their enemies could do them no harm, if they would practice restraint and fortitude and have fear of Allah. It has been pointed out that the set-back they had suffered was due to the lack of some moral qualities and the existence of some evils. Since the main cause of the defeat was the greed of the archers, guarding the pass, the taking of interest has been prohibited to eradicate this evil. 121 - 175

The main theme of the verses 109 - 120 has been resumed to reassure and encourage the Muslims against the dangerous plots of their enemies. 175 - 189

########################################################################################


############################ CONCLUSION #################################################

This is the conclusion of the Surah and is not directly connected with the verses immediately preceding it but with the theme of the Surah as a whole. 190 - 200
3.200
O you who have believed, persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.

================

################## From Google Scholar - not from Quaran directly ###########################
=> Her name is the book is Maryam which is similar to another Mary (Miriam), which is actually NOT Mother Mary from bible but a different Mary who is Moses sister
So this Mary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam
And not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus

So in Old testament we have "Amram the father of Maryam"
In Quaran we have "Imran the father of Miriam" 
But this will be a different Mary - and the fact that Christians have 2 Mary is contradicted here.
Top names who argue this as  Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai & Michael Marx

There are other equally known researcher such as Stowasser concludes that "to confuse Mary the mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron in Torah is completely wrong and in contradiction to the sound Hadith and the Qur'anic text as we have established". *** Though no reason why ???  ***
