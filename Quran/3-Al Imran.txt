Suray 1-34 [ Talks about god] - Story of Imran starts from Aayat 35.
=> There is no other diety than Allah
=> He send down Quran, Torah and Gospel
=> Nothing is hidden from him, even your deepest thoughts
=> He can do whatever he wants, all he has to say is "Be"
=> The full meaning of Quaran is not known by anyone else but Allah [ 28 verses as the word Alif Lam Meen at the begining which has never been correctly translated)
=> Follow Allah and he will give you (1) Mercy, (2) Guidance
=> Even when beings as powerful as Pharohs ignored gods signs and severe punishment befall them
=> Talks about the battle in Mecca ( Aayah 3.13)
=> Worldly things give you happinesss but nothing compared to what you will get if you are good and reach the garden
=> God teaching is same as in the past, and the interpretation of Torah and Gospel differ with Quaran only where words are intentially manipulated
=> Disbelivers will have severe punishment and no power can help them 
=> And for people who follow their fake religion and belive they won't ever burn will known the turth in Day of Judgement 
=> Remember you came from Allah and to him you will return, but return as believe and you will know peace beyond anything in this world realm, but return to him as a sinner and you will know pain beyond your wildest dreams
=> If you are true to gods teaching, you are forgiven even if you are lead astray ( by the worldly forces) 
=> God specifically choose Adam, Noah the Family of Imran ( Jesus) but his teachning applies to all of humanity. 

Surah 35 [ Story of Imran begins ] 
=> Imran's wife has not been able to bear children so she decide to offer her 'womb to god'
=> She is told she is going to have a child
=> She ends up being pregnant but her husband ( Imran ) dies
=> She gives birth to a baby girl and she freaks out
=> During that time females were not accepted into temple
=> Imran's wife wrapped the baby in a shawl hands it over to the temple elders but deep down was worried people are going to treat Mary bad
=> Mary is handed under Zechariah(Imran's sister's husband) 
=> Zechariah keep Mary on a prayer room locked away from everyone
=> Zechariah visits her daily to check what she wants, but Mary never asks for anything
=> One day Zechariah finds a basket of fresh fruit in her room
=> He has Mary who gave her this, Mary says God gave me
=> Zechariah now becomes super interested in Mary and now starts teaching her 
=> Angels come visit Zechariah and tell him a prophet is going to be born from you 
=> Zechariah can't believe this , because his wife is barren, but for doubting gods words his voice is taken away for 3 days. 
=> John is born to Zechariah 

=> Mary is visited by angels who is promised a messiah Jesus ( Issa ) would be born of her [3.46 aayat ]
=> Mary asks how its possible when she is a virgin and she is told, if god says 'be' it will just happen
=> Mary is also told Jesus will learn The Torah and The Gospel from god 
=> Jesus will be able to cure the blind and the leper and give life to the dead - by the permission to Allah [ 3.49 aayat ]
=> Mary is deeply worried because for a virgin to have kid is bad
=> Months passes and Mary can now start feeling kicking inside her 
=> Scared of what people will say she runs away from the template and go to Nazareth 
=> There she starts new life as farm girl ( where did she get money to buy a farm?? ) 
=> She starts questioning her innocent, her purity because she feels god is punishing her
=> Eventually Jesus is born
=> Mary is super unhappy and even says
"I wish I had died before this happened and had vanished into nothingness!"
=> But she hears a voice ( but no one to be seen) 
=> The voice says don't cry there is a small river below you and a tree before you
=> The three was a dead dried up palm tree
=> The river will give you water and the three will give you sustainance
=> Mary surprised checks the tree, the moment she shakes the tree big ripe dates fall
=> With Allah miracle infront of her she finally again start believing her innocence and purity
=> Now with Jesus Mary decide to return to the temple
=> She is worried what people would say , suddenly her baby talks
If you meet any person say: 'I have vowed to fast for The Beneficent and may not speak to any human today.'
=> She is surprised by the miracle and takes Jesus to the template
=> People however start asking questions 
=> People than start saying bad this to her, like this is a grave sin you have committed
=> Mary puts a finger on her lips and points to the child 
=> People start saying how can I ask questions to the a newborn baby , he cant even speak 
=> But the child start talking: I am god servent and he has blessed me with knoweledge 
=> This cause a lot of people to believe Mary and this as the sign of god
=> Some however accused Mary of witchcraft, and some said baby's voice was some kind of trick
=> One of the person who disbelives is Joseph [ carpenter ]
=> He asks Mary "Can a tree come to grow without a seed?"
=> She replies "Yes, the one which Allah created for the first time."
=> He asks  "Is it possible to bear a child without a male partner?" 
=> She replies "Yes, Allah created Adam without male or female!"
=> But a special set of nonbelivers were scared 
=> They were scared everyone will now follow Jesus and their religion will disappear
=> Consequently they would lose their authority over people and decide to hide a lot of facts including Jesus speech 
[ This is interesting because the part of Jesus talking is not in Bible ]

Now starts the story of Jesus 
=> Jesus starts growing and with his age signs of prophethood begins to show
=> He is now able to correct predict ( or rather tell ) what supper is waiting for their friends at home
=> When he is 12 he is taken to Jerusalem for the first time
=> He should know nothing about the temple, but he runs away and goes a room where Jews priest is giving lecture 
=> Everyone else are adult, he is 12 year kid alone but he is not scared
=> After the initial lecture the Jews priest asks for comments
=> Jesus, a 12 year kid , and the lecturer start having long arguments ( not heated ) 
=> they both enjoy it so much they both lose track of time
=> Meanwhile Mary is looking for Jesus and cant find him anywhere 
=> Mary eventually finds Jesus in the temple discussing with adults
=> Mary gets angry for Jesus for causing her trouble but all the adults start prasing Jesus knoweledge

=> Jesus grow to manhood
=> It is the day of Sabbath
=> Jesus is walking sees a child who looks hungry 
=> He picks 2 fruits and give it to the child
=> This is considered voilation of the law of Sabbath
=> Going further down he sees a woman freezing so he create a fire keep her warm
=> Jesus Reaches the template and sees few priests but a lot of sheeps
=> Every step in the temple cost money and they appear to be worshipping nothing but money 
=> We are told this area is ruled by 2 people Pharisees and Sadducees 
=> Rich were getting rich and poor were getting poorer, some could barely even afford food

=> At this time elsewhere, Zechariah and his son John are killed by the ruling authority
=> On the same night Jesus has his revelation
=> God commands Jesus to "begin his call to the children of Isreal"
=> Overtime Jesus fulfilled his profecy 
=> He overthrew the existing law and made them follow the teaching of Moses
=> Jesus taught his people to forget about worldly gold and strive for nobel life
=> He was deared loved 
=> But Jesus was in conflict with what he belives is a modification of teaching of Moses and have issues with Jews
=> Jesus kept saying he was not here to abolish the Torah but to extend it
=> Jews did not take kindly to this
=> He starts teaching Jews the meaning of 10 commandments 
=> The 5th commandment is "you shall not kill" 
=> Jesus teaches Jesus this kill  physical, psychological, or spiritual



################# OTHER TIDBITS ######################

=> God shows up before Jesus with a message 
"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ."
=> God also says those who follow "give them in full their rewards" 
=> Those who refuse god will punish them "with a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers."


Aayat 3.57 onwards
=> We draw parallel between the story of Adam and story of Jesus 
=> Just like Adam who was created from dust and eventually returned to him
=> Jesus did the same 

Aayat 3.68 
=> Abraham was neither Christian nor Jew, but was Muslim believier in 1 god ( Allah )

Aayat 3.75
=> There are 2 kinds of people 
1) he who, if you entrust him with a great amount, he will return it to you
2)  he who, if you entrust him with a silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him

=> 1 are people of Allah and 2 are disbelievers 
=> True believes should "Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied." [Aayat 3.79]

Aayat 3.84 
=> Jews and Christians, at least the true ones are all muslims
"We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims to Him."
  
Aayat 3.96
=> the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Makkah

Aayat 3.104 -105 
=> God tells Jesus to raise a nation and invite them to do all that is good 
=> Let them enjoy what is right, and forbid them from what is wrong 
=> And those who follow shall be successful ( by the defination of god )

Aayat 107 and onwards 
=> God wants to abolish injustice 
=> Everything will return to him

God now starts talking about Mohammand
=> When people have believe Allah they have known to have great nation
=> But when they fell wicked, the nations fell as well
=> Those who chose to not believe will suffer but that's not god punishing them but them punishing themselves (3.117)
=> Belivers will get a garden to abide in eternally [3.136 ]
=> Muhammad is just a messager [ 3.144 ]
=> After death your worth will be mesured in how much you know the words of god [  3.186]
=> People who have suffered in the name of god will be taken to the garden as a gift [  3.196 ]

The main moral of the story being 3.200
O you who have believed, persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.


################## From Google Scholar - not from Quaran directly ###########################
=> Her name is the book is Maryam which is similar to another Mary (Miriam), which is actually NOT Mother Mary from bible but a different Mary who is Moses sister
So this Mary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam
And not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus

So in Old testament we have "Amram the father of Maryam"
In Quaran we have "Imran the father of Miriam" 
But this will be a different Mary - and the fact that Christians have 2 Mary is contradicted here.
Top names who argue this as  Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai & Michael Marx

There are other equally known researcher such as Stowasser concludes that "to confuse Mary the mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron in Torah is completely wrong and in contradiction to the sound Hadith and the Qur'anic text as we have established".
