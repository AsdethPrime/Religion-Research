// From bible
=> From before the great flood 
=> At his time people were wicked
=> God blessed him with the power to teach and Enoch taught
1) Repentance 
2) Obey gods commandments
=> Because Enoch was blessed by god people were naturally afraid to not follow him
=> People who followed him started being good
=> God shows up and asks Enoch to go baptise these people 
=> God also tells Enoch to go build a city named Zion
=> Enoch takes his followers, who keep increasing everyday , and build Zion
=> Enoch seems a prophecy, a great flood is going to come
=> The wicked are washed away 
=> the good are taken directly by god 
=> God also takes all the followers of Zion with him to the 4th Heaven
