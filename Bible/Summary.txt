GENSIS (1-11)
- God creates everything 
- God creates Adam and Eve in his image and asks them not to eat from the tree of Good and Evil
- Adam and Eve eat the fruit and everything starts to spiral downwards
- Adam and Eve can't trust each other 
- Cain kills his brother Able 
- Lamech collects wifes as trophies and sings of how he is more voilent than Cain ever was
- God becomes very sad of this and decides to wipe it clean with flood 
- Then he chooses Noah and his family, who take the animals and restart humanity
- Noah gets off the boats, plants a vineyard, gets totally drunk and something shady happens in the tent with his sons
- Humanity grows from here but things are still bad and ends with Tower of Bable where God scatters humanity

Gensis(12-)
- After Tower of bable we get geneology that traces back to this 1 person named Abraham 
- God says he is going to bless Abraham and through him and his family all nations are going to find god's blessing. 
- Abraham has a son Issac; then Issac has a son named Jacob and Jacob has 12 sons 
- this family is blessed by god but the family itself is fucked up 
- Two different time Abraham gives away his wife to other men by denying he is even his wife 
- Sarah gets impatient about having a son and makes him sleep with a servent girl, which causes all sorts of problems in the family 
- They get really old, think they can't have a son, and miracuilously they do and its Issac 
- Isac has 2 songs Isha and Jacob 
- Jacob wants inherience for the family who belongs to Isha , as the oldest son, so he plan on stealing it from his father (who at this point is old and blind)
- Jacob ends up getting the inherience and has 12 sons and he loves is 11th son (Joseph) way more than others so he gives him this special coat that his brothers come to hate him
- so much that they sell him to Egypt as slave
- There first he gets imprisioned but because he can interpret Pharoah's dream correctly he is made the governor of Egypt 
- A great famine hits the world and Joseph's brother come down to Egypt looking for food and find Joseph there as the ruler of land, who actually saves them from starvation.
