****************************** Leviticus ***********************************
Book of Leviticus 
-----------------------
Gods presence is like the sun, its pure power and goodness but when something mortal and corupitable gets close to such power its destroyed. 
The world "holiness" is used to describe God's pure and powerful presence, which like the sun is both good and dangerous. 
So the point of Leviticus is to show how Iseralites can live in gods presence without being destroyed. 
There are 3 ways provided 
1) Ritual (section 1-7 and 23 -27)
2) Priest (section 8-10 and 21-22)
3) Purity Laws (11-15 and 18-20)

- Ritual, you use Scarifice as a way of ritual purification 
- Use Priest, who are held to much higher level of rightness, who act as a proxy for normal people 
- 3rd solution is purity law; rule is when you are in a pure state you can be close to gods presence but you can't if you are impure. 
- There is mortal purity; as ritual purity (pure from influence of death)
- Outcome: by following these rules Moses is finally able to enter the Tabernacle
